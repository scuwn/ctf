### pwn
- **pwn100**: guided, easy buf overflow
- **pwn101**: guided, easy buf overflow but need use pwntools
- **notepad**: use after free -> buf overflow ret2win
- **babyoverflow**: negative indexing for buf underflow
- **i am speed**: misc-ish pwn, buf overflow ret2win 30 programs in 60 sec

Attempted to solve but unfortunately did not:
- **isEven**: i assumed it was only one byte overflow but actually the binary was weird and something stack frame location
- **two wrongs don't make a right**: leak canary, ROP chain
- **BabyCPP**: virtual tables hack
